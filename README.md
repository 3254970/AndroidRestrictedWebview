Bien sûr ! Voici la version mise à jour du fichier "README.md" avec les instructions pour changer le nom du package :

# Android Restricted WebView

The Android Restricted WebView is an Android application template that allows you to display a specific website using a WebView while restricting access to other sites. If the application attempts to load a URL other than the allowed site, an error message "This URL is not allowed" will be displayed.

## Configuration

To configure the application and set the allowed website, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in Android Studio.
2. Navigate to the `MainActivity.java` file.
3. Locate the line 26 containing the `ALLOWED_URL` constant.
4. Replace the value of the `ALLOWED_URL` constant with the desired URL for the allowed site.
   ```java
   private static final String ALLOWED_URL = "https://www.example.com";
   ```
5. Save the changes.

Make sure to provide a valid URL for the website you want to allow in the application.

## Changing the Package Name

To change the package name of the application, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in Android Studio.
2. Locate the `build.gradle` file (Module: app).
3. In the `build.gradle` file, find the line 9 containing the `applicationId`.
4. Replace the value of the `applicationId` with the desired package name.
   ```gradle
   defaultConfig {
       // ...
       applicationId "com.example.newpackagename"
       // ...
   }
   ```
5. Sync the project with Gradle to apply the changes.

Ensure that the new package name follows the proper naming conventions.

## Usage

After configuring the allowed URL and optionally changing the package name, you can run the application on an Android emulator or device. The application will display the web page of the allowed site within the WebView.

If an attempt is made to load a URL other than the allowed site, the application will display an error message "This URL is not allowed" instead of the content.

## Customization

The Android Restricted WebView template can be customized to meet your specific requirements. You can add additional features, modify the application's appearance, or implement additional restrictions on websites.

To further customize the application, explore the project's files and resources, including layout XML files (`activity_main.xml`, `content_main.xml`, etc.) and Java files (`MainActivity.java`, etc.).
